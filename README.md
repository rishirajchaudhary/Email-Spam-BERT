# Email-Spam-BERT
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect whether an email is spam or not using the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model.

# Getting Started
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Download the pre-trained BERT model from the official website or use Hugging Face's Transformers library to load a pre-trained BERT model.
Prepare the dataset for training by cleaning and preprocessing the emails.
Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the validation set.
Test the model on the testing set and report the final accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Prerequisites
This project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
Hugging Face's Transformers library
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn

# Preprocessing
Before feeding the emails into the BERT model, we need to preprocess them by performing the following steps:

Remove any HTML tags and URLs.
Convert all text to lowercase.
Remove all non-alphanumeric characters and punctuation.
Tokenize the emails into words and remove any stop words.
Pad the tokenized emails to a fixed length.
$ Fine-tuning BERT
We will fine-tune the pre-trained BERT model on the Enron-Spam dataset using TensorFlow. The following steps will be performed:

Load the pre-trained BERT model using Hugging Face's Transformers library.
Add a classification layer on top of the BERT model.
Train the model on the preprocessed training set using a binary cross-entropy loss function.
Evaluate the model on the preprocessed validation set using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Test the model on the preprocessed testing set and report the final performance metrics.
# Results
After fine-tuning the BERT model, we achieved an accuracy of 98.4%, precision of 99.2%, recall of 97.3%, and F1-score of 98.2% on the testing set.

# Conclusion
In this project, we successfully built a machine learning model to detect whether an email is spam or not using the BERT model. The model achieved high accuracy and performance metrics, demonstrating the effectiveness of the BERT model in natural language processing tasks.
